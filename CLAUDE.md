# Mood Drone - Project Context for Claude Agents

## Project Overview
Mood Drone is an open-source web app that mimics a radio widget, inspired by Docubyte's "Guide to Computing." It plays moody ambient songs designed to create a productive work atmosphere.

**Current Branch:** `v1.1-background` (working branch)  
**Main Branch:** `master`  
**Repository:** https://github.com/Nidnogg/mood-drone  
**Live Demo:** https://nidnogg.github.io/mood-drone

## Design CSS Considerations
- Use lightweight, not too long animations with ease-in-out
- 0.377ms for everything. if it needs to be long, 5.77ms.
- opt for Gruvbox palette
- make it easy for me to change color palettes
## Recent Development Progress (Latest Commits)

## Development Commands
```bash
npm run dev      # Start development server
npm run build    # Build for production
npm run preview  # Preview production build
npm run deploy   # Deploy to GitHub Pages
```

## Project Goals & Context
This is part of a "Drone Index" - a collection of mood-based audio applications:
- **Mood Drone** - General productive ambiance (this project)
- **Sky Drone** - Brazilian music focus
- **Kuh Drone** - Personalized for specific user

The app is designed to provide ambient audio for focused work sessions, with a retro radio widget aesthetic.

## Current State
- ‚úÖ Build system modernized and working
- ‚úÖ React components structured and functional  
- ‚úÖ Basic deployment pipeline established
- üîÑ Likely working on v1.1 features (background-related based on branch name)
- üìù Ready for feature development or bug fixes

## For Future Agents
When picking up work on this project:
1. The build system is modern and stable (Vite + React)
2. Use `npm run dev` to start development
3. Main development happens on feature branches, merge to `master`
4. Focus is on ambient audio experience and retro UI aesthetics
5. Code quality standards are established (see recent cleanup commits)
